### 'Sup? 👏

I am a software engineer that lives in the Chicago area.  I am currently interested in internet privacy and decoupling from social media.  Additionally, I have ressurected the [Chicago Farmers Market Finder](https://chicagofarmersmarketfinder.com) application for the 2021 Season.   I previously ran a website called the Chicago Food Truck Finder, which is no longer around, but had almost a 9 year run as the premier food truck website in Chicago.
