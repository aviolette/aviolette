### 'Sup? 👏

I am a software engineer that lives in Nashville.  I am currently interested in internet privacy and decoupling from social media.  For my day job, I am a staff engineer at Deep6 AI.  I previously ran a website called the Chicago Food Truck Finder, which is no longer around, but had almost a 9 year run as the premier food truck website in Chicago.
